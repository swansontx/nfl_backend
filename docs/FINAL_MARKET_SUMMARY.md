## 🚀 WHAT'S NEXT

### Immediate Improvements (Can Do Now)
1. **Retrain Volume Props** with additional features
   - Add opponent defensive EPA
   - Add game script indicators
   - Add weather data (wind, dome)
   - **Expected Impact**: +15-20% hit rate improvement

2. **Lower Edge Thresholds** for conservative models
   - Carries: 5% → 3%
   - Rush Yards: 5% → 3%
   - **Expected Impact**: More betting volume

3. **Raise Edge Thresholds** for aggressive models
   - 3+ TDs: 10% → 20%
   - Pass + Rush Yards: 5% → 10%
   - **Expected Impact**: Better ROI on rare events

### Medium-Term Enhancements (1-2 Weeks)
1. **Add Advanced Features**
   - Opponent defense stats (EPA allowed per position)
   - Snap count data (usage rates)
   - Target share / carry share
   - Weather integration (wind, temp, precipitation)
   - **Expected Impact**: +10-15% ROI across all props

2. **Train 1Q/1H Player Derivatives** (4 markets)
   - Need to generate quarter/half player stat splits
   - 1Q Pass Yards, 1Q Rush Yards, 1Q Rec Yards
   - 1H versions of the same
   - **Expected Impact**: +4 markets → 40 total (50%)

3. **Calibration & Optimization**
   - Model calibration (Brier score < 0.20)
   - Hyperparameter tuning
   - Feature selection (remove low-importance features)
   - **Expected Impact**: +5-10% ROI improvement

### Long-Term (Blocked on Data)
1. **Play-by-Play Dependent Markets** (25+ markets)
   - First/Last TD Scorer
   - Longest plays (completion, rush, reception)
   - Drive props
   - **Blocker**: Need NFLverse play-by-play data (API 403 errors)

2. **Defensive Props** (5 markets)
   - Sacks, Tackles, Defensive INTs, Defensive TDs
   - **Blocker**: Need defensive player stats

3. **Exotic Props** (15+ markets)

## 🎓 KEY LEARNINGS

### What Worked
1. **L3 Average > Season Average** - Recency matters (47-79% feature importance)
2. **Position Filtering is Critical** - Without it, models fail completely
3. **TD Props > Yardage Props** - Higher hit rates and ROI
4. **Kicker Props are Predictable** - 75% hit rate on Total Points
5. **Poisson > Quantile for TDs** - Better for count data
6. **Edge Threshold Matters** - 5% minimum, 10%+ for rare events

### What Didn't Work
1. **Volume Props Without Context** - Need opponent defense, game script
2. **Combo Props Too Aggressive** - Mobile QBs unpredictable
3. **3+ TD Props** - Rare events need 20%+ edge threshold
4. **Completions/Attempts** - Missing critical features

### Best Practices
1. **Always filter by position** before training
2. **Require 3+ games** minimum for predictions
3. **Use ONLY historical data** for backtesting (no look-ahead bias)
4. **Set edge thresholds** based on prop variance
5. **Track both hit rate AND ROI** for evaluation

## 💡 RECOMMENDED NEXT ACTIONS

### Priority 1: Fix Underperforming Models (2-4 hours)
1. Add opponent defensive features to volume props
2. Retrain Completions, Attempts, Receptions, Targets
3. **Expected Outcome**: 8 models improved to >50% hit rate

### Priority 2: Generate Player Derivatives (2-3 hours)
1. Create quarter/half player stat splits
2. Train 1Q/1H yards props
3. **Expected Outcome**: +4 markets → 40 total (50%)

### Priority 3: Model Calibration (1-2 hours)
1. Check calibration curves for all models
2. Adjust probabilities if miscalibrated
3. Calculate Brier scores
4. **Expected Outcome**: Better probability estimates

### Priority 4: API Integration (4-6 hours)
1. Create prediction pipeline (models → CSV outputs)
2. Test betting API endpoints
3. Integrate with Odds API for real lines
4. **Expected Outcome**: Production-ready system
