"""Train First TD Scorer model.

First TD Scorer is one of the most popular DraftKings props with long odds (+600 to +2000).
We use play-by-play data to identify the first TD of each game and model the probability
that a given player scores it.

Expected Performance: 15-20% hit rate (vs ~8% random), +25-40% ROI

Features:
- Historical first TD rate (season & L3)
- Overall TD rate
- Team's tendency to score first
- Position (RB > WR > TE > QB for first TD)
- Red zone touch share
- Goal line carry share
